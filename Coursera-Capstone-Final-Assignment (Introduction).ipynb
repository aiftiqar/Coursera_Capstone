This project will also help me in comparing 2 different neighborhoods to choose the best suited location based on the top 10 common venues surrounding it.\n\n**Objective:**\n* Extracting top trending venues of London using Foursquare API\n* Forming neighborhood clusters based on venue categories using unsupervised k-mean clustering algorithm\n* Understanding the similarities and differences between two neighborhoods to retrieve more insights and to conclude which neighborhood is best suited for an individual\u2019s need.\n\n",

This will be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of London city over an interactive leaflet map.\n- Foursquare API will help fetch the neighborhood for the given postal codes and find the top common venues from it.\n- kMeans clustering will be used to form the clusters of surrounding neighborhoods and compare the neighborhood information\n",
